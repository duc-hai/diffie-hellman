# Diffie-Hellman Algorithm

## Introduction
The purpose of this topic is to understand the Diffie-Hellman algorithm and explore related issues such as its resistance against attacks when utilizing large prime numbers, and particularly its variant, the Diffie-Hellman algorithm with elliptic curves.
The report delves into the concept and implementation of the Diffie-Hellman algorithm, discusses potential attacks on this algorithm, and strategies for mitigation such as using large prime numbers, key security, etc. Additionally, it explores elliptic curves, their advantages, disadvantages, and their application in enhancing the security and efficiency of the Diffie-Hellman algorithm.
Apart from the theoretical aspects, the report also presents a demonstration of the Diffie-Hellman algorithm, including an interface for operations and the logical processing system of the algorithm.
